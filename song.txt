How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?
I sat ashore and watched as one
Hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the hills
My heart never, never reached the sea
With only delusions
Of an endless, endless journey
I am left with an ocean
Between you and me
An ocean between
Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream, yeah
